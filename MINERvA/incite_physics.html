# Outline

1. Physics goals
2. Comments on working at Oak Ridge

# Physics goals

Broadly, we have two types of goals:

1. Specific physics measurements where we will use the deep net to improve 
part of the measurement, or open up new possible measurements.
2. Learning how to apply deep learning to particle physics and, in particular,
how to reconcile weaknesses in the simulation.

# Physics measurements

1. Improved vertex finding in the passive target region for DIS measurements
on nuclear targets as a function of A.
2. Charged particle multiplicity in the tracker region and in the passive
targets.
3. EM/Hadronic recoil fractions.
4. Photon / neutron separation.
5. Photon shower finding.
6. Recoil energy for inclusive events.
7. Neutral pion detection.
8. Neutral current inclusive cross sections.
9. Differential cross sections in neutral current neutral pion momentum and angle.

# Fundamental problems with the generator

One of the trickiest problems we must deal with is a multitude of known deficiencies
in the simulation. 
As a GENIE author, I am well aware of the many places the generator has problems -
and these are just the "known unknowns."

# Comments on working at Oak Ridge

The computing environment is different than we are used to on FNAL VMs.
We've documented our experiences with the storage system, job submission, etc. and
we're generally happy to share what we've learned to help bootstrap projects.

[Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) is a good framework choice. 
One of the main problems on Titan is that it is not possible to run small numbers 
of long jobs - so it is very important to
have good check-point tools (run your job until it is killed and then restart it).
It is also relatively easier to use monitoring and profiling tools with a C++
base application.

We are able to run [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/index.html) 
but it is harder to profile with the tools on hand
and we need to develop a checkpoint system in order to run longer jobs.
Likely this means we need to finally begin migrating to Caffe for production.

# Scaling for INCITE

We need to demonstrate that we can actually use a significant portion of Titan.
This means we need to be able to productively deploy many thousands of jobs.
Generically, I see two ways to scale deep learning applications on Titan's
hardware:

1. Run many, many configurations of the "same" network tackling an identical 
problem and use the multitude of configurations to optimize a network and 
hopefully learn something abot why it is optimal.
2. Run many networks attacking different problems. The more physics questions
we can ask with the same datasets, the better. This means we need good metadata
tracking and that we need lots of different problems.

Ultimately, we will need to do _both_.
R. Patton and S. Young's evolutionary hyper-parameter optimization will be very
helpful for part 1.
For part 2 we need carefully explore the set of questions we can attack efficiently.
What data sets can we re-use?
Are we better preparing very general datasets?
Or are the advantages of target or tracker region datasets worth it? 
How much MC event metadata can we reasonably store?
